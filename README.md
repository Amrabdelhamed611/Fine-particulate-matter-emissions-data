# # Fine particulate matter emissions data in  United States analysis
 
 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an ambient air pollutant for which there is strong evidence that it is harmful to human health. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with setting national ambient air quality standards for fine PM and for tracking the emissions of this pollutant into the atmosphere. Approximatly every 3 years, the EPA releases its database on emissions of PM2.5. This database is known as the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). You can read more information about the NEI at the [EPA National Emissions Inventory web site](http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/eiinformation.html).
this project focus on doing some data analysis on fine particulate matter emissions in united states analysis done on subset of the original data by [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/home/welcome) course team on  **coursera**.
will do the analysis by asking some questions and answer them with Exploratory graphs.


# Files
**1 -summarySCC_PM25.RDS**
PM2.5 Emissions Data  **summarySCC_PM25.RDS** This file contains a data frame with all of the PM2.5 emissions data for 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. For each year, the table contains number of **tons** of PM2.5 emitted from a specific type of source for the entire year.
   -   fips: A five-digit number indicating the U.S. county
   -   SCC: The name of the source as indicated by a digit string 
   -   Pollutant: A string indicating the pollutant
   -   Emissions: Amount of PM2.5 emitted, in tons
   -   type: The type of source (point, non-point, on-road, or non-road)
   -   year: The year of emissions recorded
   
**2-Source_Classification_Code_Table.RDS**
This table provides a mapping from the SCC digit strings in the Emissions table to the actual name of the PM2.5 source. The sources are categorized in a few different ways from more general to more specific and you may choose to explore whatever categories you think are most useful. For example, source “10100101” is known as “Ext Comb /Electric Gen /Anthracite Coal /Pulverized Coal”. 

**3-scripts and plots pairs** 
each script construct plot each pair answer single question. 

## Data Analysis

The overall goal to explore the National Emissions Inventory database by some questions and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999–2008. use  R packages to support the analysis.

**1-Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008?**
- Using the **base** plotting system, to make

 - the plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. is decreasing from more then 7 millions tons to less then 2 millions tons in the ten years period.

- the plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources in Baltimore city for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.has over all decreasing over the 10 years but 2002 has less emission then 2005.

**3-Of the four types of sources indicated by the type variable, which of  four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City?and Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008?**

- the plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources according to the source type in Baltimore city for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008. 
**type nonpoint:** is decreasing over the 10 years but still has the highest
PM2.5 emissions
 **type point:** is increasing over the 10 years and the PM2.5 emissions has
high spike in 2005 and decreased in 2008 but 2008 still has PM2.5 emissions then 1999
**nonroad and road:** is decreasing over the 10 years and has the least PM2.5 emissions

**4-Across the United States, how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999–2008?**

- the plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all coal combustion-related sources is decreasing over the 10 years and the lowest value was in 2008.

**5-How have emissions from motor vehicle sources changed from 1999–2008 in Baltimore City?**
